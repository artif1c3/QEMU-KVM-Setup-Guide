# QEMU/KVM Setup for Gaming

This guide will help in setting up a Kernel-based Virtual Machine(KVM) with a GPU and USB mouse/keyboard passthrough on an AMD platform. Windows 10 will be used as the OS for this KVM.  

**This guide will not be covering single GPU passthrough**, instead it will cover how to perform a GPU passthrough on an NVIDIA GPU, with an older AMD GPU model as the main display device.   

QEMU/KVM and Virtual Machine Manager will be used in this guide.
